  A nuclear explosion of 200 kilotons destroys Jamaliya, a city of millions in Dravida Nadu, southern India. 800,000 people are killed, three million are injured and 15 million are left homeless. The profile of the explosion suggests an antimatter reaction. The official investigation suspects the cause is an illegal Amat reactor in a suburb near the Tiruvathevan Engineering College. The true circumstances don't come to light until 100 years later.
  The antimatter detonation was actually caused by an illegal reactor, but not, as assumed, by a technical error. It was rather deliberately triggered as part of a secret operation on Earth. The explosion was intended to cover up another crime.
  The operation "Eryu" (= whispering) was carried out by the Solar Coalition's intelligence agency represented by Dianfu Fuwu (= recapture), the subversion unit of Xinyu Xin Duohui tasked with reclaiming the Earth as part of the intelligence agency of Xinyu Xin, a lunar mega sovereignty. Dianfu Fuwu experimented in Jamaliya with a meme virus. For this purpose, a designer virus was released that was to change opinions and beliefs of the infected. Dianfu Fuwu had developed the virus in a lab in lunar orbit with the goal of making the planetary population more receptive to expansionist propaganda. The virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and manipulates neural processing by releasing hormones and directly activating neurons.  However, the selection of suitable neural areas proved difficult. There were already extensive methods of viral depression therapy available, but the intended targeted manipulation of subconscious ideas was a new quality. Tests during the development showed a success rate of 30% for the installation of a liberal, expansionist thinking with few side effects. This was considered sufficient.
  The virus was meant to spread very slowly without any disease symptoms in order to deceive public health control. But Dianfu Fuwu failed to consider the ritual bath in the Ambuli River at the water festival, were a great many viruses got into the water quickly infecting the population of several quarters through the local water supply. At the same time, a side effect emerged that eliminated inhibitions and morals among a small number of the infected. Jamaliya was hit by an inexplicable wave of violence overnight. The infection also seemed to spread much faster than expected in the sterile environment in lunar orbit.
  Those in charge at Dianfu Fuwu feared that the health authorities would very quickly discover the cause of the wave of violence and that the Earth would react drastically to such a subversive attack of its sovereignty. Therefore, without consulting their political leaders, they ordered a field agent to blow up one of the many illegal Amat reactors in the outskirts of the city. The explosion wipes out southern Jamaliya.
  The Jamaliya conspiracy later comes to light through the disclosure of several thousand documents from the "Eryu" operation by an insider at Dianfu Fuwu. It is a testament to the extent of the Solar Coalition's covert operations on Earth during Earth's isolation, a clear violation of official policy and the Quadrupol agreements.

  [pause strong]A nuclear explosion of 200 kilotons destroys Jamaliya, a city of millions in Dravida Nadu, southern India.

  [pause strong]The operation "Eryu" – meaning – whispering.
  It was carried out by the Solar Coalition's intelligence agency.
  In this case represented by Dianfu Fuwu – meaning – subversion service.
  The subversion unit of Xinyu Xin Duohui, the intelligence agency of Xinyu Xin, a lunar mega sovereignty, being tasked with the groundwork required to reclaim the Earth.
  Dianfu Fuwu experimented in Jamaliya with a meme virus.
  For this purpose, a designer virus was released that was to change opinions and beliefs of the infected.
