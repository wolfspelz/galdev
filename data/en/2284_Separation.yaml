    *Fellow Citizens of Earth,*
    *Today, we make a decision that will define our future and the future of generations to come. As the leader of the World Council, I stand before you with a clear message: we must change our course.*
    *For centuries, we have reached beyond our planet, expanding our presence in space and achieving incredible milestones. However, in our quest for the stars, we have neglected our own world. Our Earth is in crisis – plagued by environmental destruction, social inequality, and economic disparity. We can no longer afford to ignore these urgent issues. And we can no longer afford to subsidize space.*
    *After thorough deliberation, the World Council has decided to cease supporting interplanetary development and focus our entire effort on saving Earth. This is not a rejection of our space achievements but a necessary redirection of our priorities. We must balance our ambitions with responsibility and justice, prioritizing the well-being of all Earth's inhabitants.*
    *We will embark on an unprecedented campaign to restore our planet. We will reforest vast areas, rebuild ecosystems, combat climate change, and invest heavily in education, healthcare, and sustainable livelihoods. This will not be easy. We will face hardships and sacrifices. But our ultimate goal – to save the home planet for our children – is worth any challenge.*
    *We are fully aware that our decision will impact our interplanetary partners and the broader human civilization. These changes will be difficult, but we trust in the resilience and innovation of our partners in space to continue thriving and adapting.*
    *To the peoples of Earth, I say: our journey is far from over. We are embarking on a new path, one that demands determination, sacrifice, and unity. We are committed to healing our planet, even if it takes hundreds of years. We must ensure a strong, sustainable foundation for future generations. Mother Earth will see better days.*
    *To our interplanetary allies, we value our shared achievements and anticipate a future of renewed collaboration and mutual respect. Together, we will rise to the challenges before us.*
    *This is a time for action, for unwavering resolve, and for hope. Together, we will save our planet and secure a just and sustainable future for all.*
    *Thank you.*
    Lea Perres, Speaker of the World Council, Planetary Assembly V-Hall, 2284.
    The World Council, under the leadership of Neo-Socialist Lea Perres, makes a landmark decision to disengage from interplanetary development. This decision, seen as a culmination of a series of socio-political and technological changes spanning over two centuries, profoundly alters the trajectory of human civilization. Earth's subsequent withdrawal from the United Planets Organization (UPO) five years later further cements this pivotal shift.
    A Neo-Socialist and staunch anti-expansionist, Perres rose to power as a defender of freedom against the World Friendship dictatorship. Post-liberation, Lea Perres emerges as a key figure, initially as the interim president of the planetary Union and later as majority leader and speaker of the World Council. Her leadership is characterized by a strong commitment to addressing Earth's ecological and social issues, setting the stage for the momentous decision in 2284.
    By the late 23rd century, significant technological advancements have transformed interplanetary travel and industry. Matter stream technology makes space travel more accessible and economically viable, while breakthroughs in radiation protection and therapy allow for longer stays in space. Autofabs, general-purpose 3D printers, are commonplace, particularly in space-based industries. Solar energy harvested from installations in close solar orbits powers much of the interplanetary industry, and Earth-orbiting facilities produce advanced information technology, biomedical products, and longevity treatments for the terrestrial market.
    Even though the space economy has matured, Earth's resources remain heavily directed towards space. While subsidies for space development have decreased, payments for orbital products have risen significantly, causing a continued outflow of capital from the surface to space. However, only a small fraction of Earth's population can access high-tech space products, resulting in a growing divide between those benefiting from the interplanetary economy and those left behind on Earth.
    The decision to stop any support for interplanetary development is the result of intense debates within the World Council, the governing body of the Earth Union headquartered at Crete. The council is comprised of nation-states, many of which have embraced Neo-Socialism as a counter to the World Friendship's legacy. Powerful Earth-bound gigacorporations, with only marginal space presence, support the Neo-Socialist agenda. Conversely, space-bound conglomerates, driving the expansion into the solar system, vehemently oppose the decision, citing economic and technological setbacks.
    Earth's withdrawal from the UPO significantly alters the organization's dynamics. Although Earth was a major contributor to the Space Patrol and held substantial influence due to its size, population, and economic power, it never dominated the UPO. Interplanetary powers, such as the nations of Mars, the Ganymede Directorate, and the Palladian League, although much smaller in population, are economically powerful through large-scale automation. They never trusted the Earth-controlled Space Patrol, as it had attempted to prevent their independence movement long ago. They perceive Earth's departure as both liberating and challenging. They no longer feel constrained by Earth's influence but face the daunting task of replacing the lost economic and technological support.
    Earth not only ceases to subsidize space operations but also shuts down large and expensive scientific instruments in the asteroid belt. Even more important and devastating for the orbital economy, Earth enacts laws prohibiting any business with space beyond geostationary orbit.
    Interplanetary facilities and orbital habitats face a severe economic hit due to the loss of Earth as a market and source of advanced technologies and nutrients. Despite their efforts to adapt, the interplanetary economy struggles without the substantial terrestrial support it once relied on. This period of adjustment is marked by hardships, with many outposts struggling to survive. Emergencies arise where station infrastructure breaks down, leading to substantial loss of life. More than one space station or remote base fails due to lack of income, reserves, or essential volatiles. Desperate repair attempts, last supply runs, and final evacuations become common. Space is already dangerous under optimal conditions, but when resources become scarce, equipment and societies begin to fall apart, sometimes with fatal consequences. It is a difficult time. However, eventually, the interplanetary civilization becomes more self-sufficient and independent of Earth.
    Public reaction to the decision is mixed. While the general populace on Earth, having seen little benefit from space development beyond Earth orbit, largely supports the new focus on ecological and economic rehabilitation, significant opposition exists. Large member states and corporate interests favoring expansionism view the decision as a setback. A radical expansionist movement emerges. This group, feeling cut off from the potential of space and the future it represents, organizes resistance against the Neo-Socialist policies, advocating for a return to interplanetary ambitions. Militant expansionists believe that humanity's future lies in the stars fearing that a solely Earth-bound existence will lead to stagnation and decline. This movement becomes a source of internal conflict, challenging the Neo-Socialist government's policies for a long time.
    Earth's decision to separate itself from interplanetary development, along with its subsequent complete disengagement from all space-related activities beyond Earth’s orbit, marks a pivotal moment in human history. This monumental shift sets the stage for a profound divergence between Earth's trajectory and that of the interplanetary settlements. Over the next 200 years, these civilizations evolve independently, resulting in significant differences in culture, arts, customs, and mentality. This separation has severe consequences when humanity eventually encounters interstellar contacts as vastly different worldviews, and deep-seated misunderstandings between Earth and Space lead to new conflict.
