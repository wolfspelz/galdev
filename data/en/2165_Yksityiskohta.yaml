  First global convention of the Yksityis movement called "YZero Con". 
  The convention is a virtual gathering of Yksityis followers, a V-Con. The event is held annually with a rapidly growing number of participants. There are 20.000 participants in 2165. Five years later there is one million. Another ten years later, around 2180, the V-Con, despite being virtual, reaches its organizational limits at 20 million participants worldwide.
  Yksityiskohta (also Yksityis, Eeqsitis) is a new religious movement based on the belief in the individual and on the conviction that that the common good emerges from many contributions of independent individuals relying on the faith in the now and in the reward in the real world through work, also in reward from nature through care for nature.
  Yksityis originated in northern Europe during the crash, when all networks failed and people were cut off from energy, information, and food supply. In the middle of the 21st century and before the crash, the countries of northern Europe belonged to the most advanced regions on Earth. They were therefore particularly hard hit by the failure of technology, and by the harsh northern climate, which suddenly became a serious issue when the energy supply failed. When large organizations, including the churches, were unable to help, people concentrated on themselves and their own abilities.
  Since the turn of the millennium there has been a growing trend in northern Europe, as in many other regions, where people turned away from organized religions. Many people now find a new spiritual home in Yksityis, which matches their new reality better than the book religions. 
  Important elements of Yksityis are self-regulation (homeostasis) and self-organization in learning systems. There are influences from the Gaia hypothesis, from nature religions, Shintoism with kami in all things, and – for particularly committed believers – shamanism, including the use of psychoactive substances.  
  The movement is driven by the people. There are no formal organizations or thought leaders. Faith in authority has suffered after the painful experiences following the crash when many communities were cut off from civilization and had to cope on their own. During the first years they had to rely on themselves and on nature. They could only use what nature offered. The term nature, having been synonymous with the threatened environment in the middle of the 21st century, has turned into the meaning of life-giver, in the sense of Gaia and Mother Earth.
  The western trend towards individualization and individual freedom gained strength as the power of nation states shrank. On the organizational level, Yksityis means decentralization and subsidiarity, with emphasis on self-determination and personal responsibility. This reflects an upbringing that has shaped an entire generation when problems had to be solved in local communities. The new view also leads to the rejection of control and supervision, by the state, and by any kind of social and religious organizations.
  The subsidiarity aspect of Yksityis can also be found in *Eter* technologies, which are strongly influenced by northern European corporations.
