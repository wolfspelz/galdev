  The human population living off Earth including uploads has reached an impressive one million people, spread across various structures throughout the solar system. There are a total of 12,000 structures, including space stations, spacecraft, industrial facilities, rotating habitats, asteroid bases, and automated infrastructures. These structures reflect the advanced technological capabilities and the multitude of enterprises from private, corporate, and state actors driving humanity's presence in space.
  Earth orbit remains a significant hub of activity with a population centered around rotating habitats that house 320,000 individuals. In addition, space stations, industrial facilities, and various other structures support an additional 65,000 people, reflecting Earth's orbital space as a bustling commercial region.
  The Moon and cislunar space have also become major centers of human settlement. The Moon supports 210,000 people, predominantly in large moon bases, with additional populations in industrial facilities and space stations. Cislunar space, the area between Earth and the Moon including the Lagrange points, hosts another 230,000 individuals, mostly in rotating habitats and space stations, illustrating its role as a critical zone for both habitation and industrial activity.
  Beyond the Earth-Moon system, Mars emerges as the next significant population center with 40,000 inhabitants spread across ground bases, spacecraft, and industrial facilities. The inner planets, including Venus and Mercury, and the asteroid belt support smaller yet substantial communities, focused on research, and industrial production. Specifically, the cloud cities of Venus house 50,000 people, showcasing the ingenuity and adaptability of human expansion. Close solar orbits are home to significant energy infrastructure supported by 20,000 people, crucial for powering the myriad of human activities across the solar system. Outer regions, such as the outer planets and solar orbits, contribute to the human presence with a total of 20,000 individuals, highlighting the solar system's extensive human footprint and the widespread adoption of advanced spacefaring technologies.
