	The hub council of Vesta-Prime proclaims Transorbital Equilibrium as state doctrine.
	The transorbital movement was born out of a scientific economic theory that transformed classical models to address the fluctuating dynamics of solar epicycles. It optimized the economy of interplanetary civilization in a dynamic environment where distances constantly shifted between trading partners, producers, and consumers. Trading partners that were close at one point in time could be far apart a year later. Additionally, orbital dynamics resulted in very different delta-v (change in velocity) constellations and thus energy and cost requirements for different transfer orbits.
	# History
	In the 2320s, following Earth's separation, the interplanetary civilization experienced a period of economic chaos. When Earth was still the economic center of the Sol system, most trade, traffic, and space activity originated from Earth-Moon space. For a century, the regions of the solar system on the same side as Earth had prospered, while regions on the opposite side of the Sun experienced significant economic decline. 
	After Earth had severed its connections, interplanetary trade became more equally distributed. While Near-Earth space still played a major role, the rest of the Sol system became more important and traded more within and between orbital zones rather than exclusively with Earth-Moon.
	In the 2340s, after recovering from the Earth-separation shock, it became clear that the epicyclic characteristics of an interplanetary economy required a new paradigm. Theoretical foundations had already been developed decades earlier, but the strong focus on Earth-Moon space had prevented them from being tested in the real world. Simulations showed promising results, and by the 2350s – after two decades of interplanetary trade and experimentation – Transorbital Equilibrium was formally adopted as a comprehensive economic theory.
	In 2366, the hub council of Vesta-Prime adopted Transorbital Equilibrium as its official economic doctrine. 
	Over the next four decades, the economic theory – originally intended to improve interplanetary trade – transformed into a political doctrine used to justify imperialistic conquest. Another thirty years later, Transorbital Equilibrium evolved into a religious movement that was misused by some factions as an instrument for religiously motivated colonization and suppression.
	But until then, Transorbital Equilibrium had truly transformed the solar economy, bringing unprecedented stability.
	# Theory
	Transorbital Equilibrium emerged as a revolutionary economic framework addressing the unique challenges of interplanetary civilization. Unlike Earth-bound economic theories that assumed static distances and stable transport cost between economic actors, Transorbital Equilibrium recognized that the fundamental nature of space-based commerce required entirely new paradigms. 
	The theory rested on three foundations:
	- Epicyclic Valuation: Perhaps the most transformative aspect of the theory was its reconceptualization of value. While traditional economics treated value as emerging from utility, scarcity, and labor, Transorbital Equilibrium added a fourth dimension: orbital positioning. The Epicyclic Valuation Principle stated that any good's true economic value incorporated not just current demand but also orbital accessibility across multiple transfer windows. This led to the development of sophisticated "transfer-adjusted valuation" models that could predict price movements years in advance based on celestial mechanics.
	- Temporal Buffers: The theory advocated for strategic positioning of resource buffers throughout the system, synchronized with orbital cycles. Rather than requiring each habitat to maintain independent stockpiles of all necessary resources, Transorbital Equilibrium demonstrated that system-wide stability could be achieved with significantly lower total inventory if those reserves were positioned according to orbital dynamics.
	- Kinetic Liquidity: Traditional economics treated transportation as a service with a cost. Transorbital Equilibrium recognized that in space, transportation capacity itself – specifically delta-v – was the most fundamental resource underpinning all others. The theory formalized delta-v as both a resource and a currency, creating the concept of "kinetic liquidity", the ability to move mass through the solar system. Habitats and stations began trading in delta-v futures and options, allowing for risk management of transportation capacity across orbital cycles. Unlike purely deterministic orbital calculations, delta-v futures trading incorporated speculation about potential technological breakthroughs. This speculative component actually served to smooth technological transitions by gradually pricing in innovation possibilities, thereby preventing market shocks when new propulsion technologies suddenly altered transportation economics.
	A key strength of Transorbital Equilibrium emerged in its handling of unexpected disruptions. The system incorporated "orbital contingency reserves" – strategically positioned emergency resources that could be quickly rerouted during solar events or other crises. The theory's distributed buffer network proved remarkably robust against localized disruptions.
	When the massive solar flare sequence temporarily disabled the Venus-Belt transfer routes, pre-positioned reserves at Deimos automatically activated, releasing strategic materials according to pre-calculated contingency transfers.
	Rather than experiencing extreme boom-bust cycles as transfer windows opened and closed, economies began to experience gentle, predictable price oscillations. The theory transformed interplanetary commerce from a chaotic, often desperate scramble into a harmonious dance – with each planet, moon, and habitat playing its economic role in rhythm with its celestial movement. The beauty of Transorbital Equilibrium was that it didn't fight against the fundamental reality of orbital mechanics – it embraced them, turning what had been unpredictable disruptions into the very foundation of a stable economic system that spanned the solar system.
	Several high-profile success stories paved the way to universal adoption: 
	# Renaissance of Phobos Manufacturing 
	Third-generation manufacturer Hiroshi Tanaka had watched his family's precision fabrication business survive on razor-thin margins for decades. "We lived by the transfer windows," he recalled. "Six months of frantic production, six months of near bankruptcy, never able to expand." When Phobos started subsidizing orbital futures contracts, Tanaka initially resisted the complex financial instruments. 
	His conversion moment came during what should have been a lean period – when for the first time in his life, parts from Gemini continued arriving at stable prices despite Mars and Earth being at their furthest orbital distance. Within three years, Tanaka Industries had tripled its workforce and opened two new production lines. "We stopped living in fear of the planets' positions. For the first time, we could plan beyond the next conjunction." Tanaka said at the grand opening of a new shipbuilding facility on Deimos that would later become the famous Deimos Interstellars Corp.
	# An Impossible Trade Corridor
	Prior to Transorbital Equilibrium, the trade relationship between Ganymede (at Jupiter) and Titan (at Saturn) was considered economically unfeasible due to the extreme variations in transfer costs as the gas giants moved through their orbits. The corridor would operate profitably for approximately 2.8 years, followed by 11.2 years of prohibitive costs. 
	When veteran hauler Captain Kwame Oluwaseyi announced her intent to establish a permanent Ganymede-Titan trade route, veteran spacers called it suicide – or worse, economic delusion. "My own navigator quit rather than participate in what he called 'celestial bankruptcy'," Oluwaseyi recalled. Her innovation was leveraging the new delta-v banking system to accumulate massive kinetic credits during the brief favorable alignments of Jupiter and Saturn. Banking these credits allowed her vessels to maintain operations during the long unfavorable periods that had previously made the route impossible. "The physics of orbital mechanics hadn't changed," Oluwaseyi noted at her shipping company's public offering, "but the economics had."
	# Methane Markets Stabilization
	Titan's atmosphere had long been recognized as the system's richest source of methane, but harvesting operations suffered catastrophic volatility due to Saturn's long orbital period. After implementing Transorbital Equilibrium's Temporal Buffer Distribution, strategically positioned processing and storage facilities throughout the asteroid belt created a constant supply of methane regardless of Saturn's position. Price volatility decreased dramatically, while total system-wide methane reserves actually decreased by 50% through the elimination of redundant emergency stockpiles.
	These triumphs, however, masked growing systemic vulnerabilities. Over time, broad application exposed Transorbital Equilibrium's dark side: consequences that proved utterly inhuman and sometimes even deadly:
	# The ISO Information Asymmetry Scandal
	While Transorbital Equilibrium created predictable market movements, it also enabled unprecedented market manipulation by those with privileged information. When the well respected independent statistics oracle, the ISO, delayed announcing revised asteroid belt mining quotas by just 10 days, connected traders with advance knowledge accumulated massive delta-v option positions. The resulting wealth transfer undermined public trust in the system and revealed how orbital futures markets could be manipulated through strategic information releases.
	# A Ghost Buffer
	The Temporal Buffer Distribution system showed a dangerous vulnerability when a critical reserve of volatiles supposedly positioned on Callisto turned out to exist only in networked accounting records. The facility had been selling its physical inventory while maintaining the fiction of a fully stocked reserve. 
	When the passenger liner *Sagittarius Not A Star* requested emergency resupply from the buffer depot that existed only in the system's ledgers, the discrepancies became lethal. With insufficient life support and no alternative sources within reach, the ship drifted for weeks before rescue arrived. Thirteen passengers died in what investigators dubbed "The Ghost Buffer Tragedy," revealing how Transorbital Equilibrium's elegant mathematical models had become dangerously disconnected from physical reality.
	# The Morrison Exploit
	At the height of Transorbital Equilibrium's implementation, delta-v futures trading had created unprecedented stability – and unprecedented opportunities for manipulation. Broker Alexandra Morrison identified a mathematical flaw in the system's predictive algorithms affecting Ceres-based temporal buffers. Rather than reporting the vulnerability, she exploited it, creating complex derivative instruments that appeared to follow equilibrium principles while actually concentrating risk. When a minor perturbation occurred, her carefully constructed financial edifice collapsed. This triggered the *Ceres Cascade*, which wiped out seven major delta-v banks. Hundreds of ships were left stranded mid-transit without their guaranteed fuel credits. The system that promised stability had created the perfect conditions for a single point of failure.
	# Orphaned Orbits
	As Transorbital Equilibrium matured, a troubling pattern emerged where habitats, stations, and resource extraction operations situated on "non-optimal" orbits found themselves systematically excluded from trade networks. These "orphaned orbits" didn't fit neatly into the valuation models adjusted for orbital transfer costs, making them unattractive nodes in the system despite sometimes having valuable resources or strategic importance. Over time, this created a two-tier system – habitats either on "calculated optimal" orbits that thrived, and those gradually abandoned as economically unsustainable regardless of their intrinsic value. 
	In 2410, outer system native Lucy Dhien from Harmonia Station at Iapetus arrived at the Mars Trade Academy on a rare scholarship, only to discover the true extent of the system's economic stratification. "They taught us that Transorbital Equilibrium had created system-wide prosperity," she recounted in her famous memoir. "From my dormitory window, I could see the huge V-billboard of CTSO, the Coalition Transorbital Settlement Office, that controlled the destiny of my home habitat cluster." Her subsequent research exposed how habitats at optimal transfer intersections had systematically gained control of up to 90% of all delta-v banking reserves. "They called it orbital optimization," Dhien wrote. "I called it celestial feudalism – a new aristocracy based on the mathematical advantage of orbital positioning."
	"After graduating, I studied TE in depth with a specific focus on resource routing algorithms. I was determined to find a way to bring more traffic to those orphaned orbits without harming the overall economy. And I did. I published my results. It was a small revolution in TE economics: a solution to a long standing-problem, an optimization in parts without breaking the whole, the squaring of a circle if you like. In particular, I was able to show that a modest change in the mathematics behind TE would restore traffic through Iapetus to three quarters of pre-crisis levels while deducting at most three percent from other participants – just a year's worth of growth. Quite a good outcome that would save Harmonia Station, among many, with only minor cost to other places. They even offered me a tenured position at TERI, the renowned Transorbital Economics Research Institute – an economics scholar's dream."
	"My algorithmic improvements worked their way through CTSO. They repeated my simulations, did small scale field tests, and various impact assessments. The modifications were sent back several times on minor issues. I provided more detail, smoothed some rough edges – and watched them slowly die. After 4 years of stop and go, we got caught in a byzantine web of office politics, internal power struggles, and competing lobbyist interests. Last I heard were concerns about 'unintended cascading effects on established settlement investment portfolios'. Apparently, some of the major orbital banking consortiums had expressed reservations about potential disruptions to their long-term positional derivatives. The final blow came when the Ceres Commercial Collective submitted a formal objection, claiming my modifications could destabilize their carefully balanced supply chain rotations."
	"It was all nonsense, of course. Pure mathematical theater designed to protect existing power structures. The truth was simpler and uglier: my reforms threatened to redistribute wealth from the orbital aristocracy to the orphaned settlements, and they simply wouldn't allow it. The CTSO commissioner who had initially championed my work suddenly found himself transferred to a 'special advisory position' on remote asteroid mining oversight. My liaison at TERI also went silent."
	When Lucy Dhien returned to her birthplace, Harmonia Station, after fifteen years away she found a ghost town. Once a thriving mining community of six thousand, the station had been gradually abandoned as Transorbital Equilibrium's optimization algorithms designated its orbit "economically non-viable" despite its abundant mineral resources and a century of continuous habitation. Iapetus fell outside the primary delta-v network pathways calculated by the system's algorithms. Trading partners disappeared as they shifted to "optimal" routes, buffer depots were relocated, and emergency reserve allocations were zeroed out. "The corridors where I played as a child stood empty," Dhien documented in her memoir. "Not because the station failed, but because an equation determined it should fail."
