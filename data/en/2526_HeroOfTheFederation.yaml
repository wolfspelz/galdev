  Przemyslaw Hrycyszyn is the first child born outside of the Solar system. He is the first of 59 children born on Cobol during the first colonization attempt. Having survived the "Tragedy of Cobol" at the age of eight he enters the Solar system on a rescue ship.
  At the age of 37, Hrycyszyn returns to Cobol. There he works as biosphere scout for the terraforming project. Before many others he realizes that the original biosphere of Cobol is threatened by the spread of human settlements. Hrycyszyn advocates for the creation of large nature reserves. As a leading preservationist he must repeatedly confront aggressive opponents, who call him an enemy of progress.
  Hrycyszyn goes into politics. He plays a major role in passing the Hrycyszyn-Yijieyjiee Law of 2618 that closes the Papua continent to human settlements.
  At the age of 85, Hrycyszyn becomes Governor of Nowylwiw. He keeps the office for 30 years. It is a time of great changes. The population is growing from one million settlers living in biosphere enclaves spread over an entire planet to over 30 million inhabitants of open cities. Small settlements become metropolises. Many initially self-sufficient communities now take part in an interconnected economy. At the same time a lively interplanetary civilization develops in Cobol's orbit.
  The Papua continent remains largely protected. But the rapid growth of the population keeps triggering conflicts that call the Papua Nature Reserve into question.
  During Hrycyszyn's terms in office the politics are also changing. Initially there were hundreds of independent territories established by many different groups. Cobol has the whole range of human bios, from Sol-drop-outs with paleo-DNA to modern gene templates forming the largest part in the Solar system, to extravagant gene mods that flee to Cobol to escape persecutions on Earth. From the very beginning, Cobol has been as politically fragmented as the Earth, ethnically even more so. 
  Hrycyszyn advocates for the unification of all territories into a political union. In 2640, 89 years after the founding of the second colony most planetary territories and orbital habitats merge into the Cobol Federation. Hrycyszyn assumes office as Federal Commissioner for Infrastructure.
  Only three years later neo-barbarians invade the Cobol system. In the short time between the first contact and the beginning of the occupation Hrycyszyn makes sure that important resources and autofabs are brought to safety.
  At the age of 118 he joins the resistance. Then Hrycyszyn fights the occupying forces as a scout, a sniper, and a guerilla commander for 14 years. In 2656, just one year before the end of the occupation Hrycyszyn is killed in a guerrilla action at the age of 131.
  On his 137th birthday Hrycyszyn is posthumously honored by the Federation Parliament as the "Child of Cobol and Hero of the Federation".
  His birthday falls on a national holiday, the Liberation Day, which since is called Przemek's Day (short of Przemyslaw).
