    First successful spacetime shift demonstrated as a precursor to faster-than-light travel
    At the Metric Field Research Facility (MFRF)
    Basic principle is use virtual particles of negative mass that are made real particles of effective negative mass by a quantum mirror that separates virtual particles
    This is like an event horizon but only for the particles in question
    Over time the type of particle varies very much with the available technology
    A huge machinery is used to create a space bending effect in some small volumes
    The engines used look like a particle accelerator
    Actually, they employ particle accelerators to generate and store the required high-energy particles and the device for creating and observing the spacetime-shift effect is very similar to a large particle detector
    Thousands of people work on these experiments over decades
    Relevant physics theories and technologies involved: spin-graph quantum space-time (SGQS , as the theoretical foundation), quantum mirror by weak symmetry breaking (to separate virtual particles), localized Higgs field shift (LHFS, to stabilize the negative mass particles for long enough), quantum entanglement (to control the generating particles over a relatively long, yet microscopic distance), and later Grundarfjördur-Zilberstein isochoric scaling (to make space time bubble shifts permanent)
    The efforts produce the first enclosed micro-scale space-time volume that is shifted in normal space
    Initially the micro-bubble can only be shifted on very short dimensions starting at the femtometer scale, equivalent to the size of an atomic nucleus
    This experiment results in a Nobel prize for the lead scientist of the project and for a theoretical physicist who developed the metric based on SGQS and for the leading researcher of a precursor experiment that developed many of the technologies used for the first actual bubble-shift
    However, at the time the bubble-shift required a large amount of energy that remained stored in the bent space-time
    For this reason, these experiments were conducted far from space settlements in deep space
    Without external forces the shifted bubble snapped back to its original position, releasing the stored energy, which resulted in several large explosions in earlier experiments that on occasion destroyed the first setups
    The first experiments even built one-shot setups that were known to be destroyed by the experiment
    Later, applying Grundarfjördur-Zilberstein in practice, scientists learn to make the shift permanent by isochoric scaling along thin sheets of bent space-time
    In the following decades large experimental setups are built with ever more advanced technologies
    The volume of bent space-time sheet shrinks while the enclosed volume grows from the femtometer scale to actually visible macroscale sizes (meaning millimeters)
    All the time there is a huge machinery necessary to produce these effects
    A lot of high energy machinery comprising particle accelerators, storage rings, energy production, compensation masses, high-tesla mag field generators, antimatter production facilities and storage, and factories for other more exotic particles
    All connected via high performance energy transducers and a hollow-core power grid
    All this just to move a small volume of space-time inside a huge machine proving the effect practically, but without any practical use
    Until humanity finally learns to produce the spacetime shift effect from inside the spacetime bubble effectively constituting a real spacecraft drive
    Though at first, they are rather big and power hungry
    They are unreliable and often fail
    They are easily interrupted in their operation by imperfect circumstances like moving masses in the vicinity or by space dust hitting the fractal converter surfaces
    In other words: they are brittle, and they need much maintenance with long downtimes
    But that will change with better technology, although FTL drives will never be simple tech
