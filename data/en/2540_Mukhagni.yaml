Short: Military forces of the inner system bombard a vulcanoid asteroid and then steer the body into the sun. Officially a test. But many observers suspect an out-of-control experiment with outlawed technology. What could be that dangerous? asymptotic AI? androidal viruses?.

  Military forces of the inner system bombard a vulcanoid asteroid and then steer the body into the sun. Officially a test. But many observers suspect an out-of-control experiment with outlawed technology.
  Mukhagni is a small asteroid inside Mercury's orbit. Sensors show several 100 megaton antimatter explosions at its position in short order. The event causes a system wide outrage. There is no official explanation. Two days later, combat units of the Magadha Sangha Federation/Venus begin firing at Mukhagni from great distance. Military units approach Mukhagni on expensive max delta-V courses from all directions under sustained firing.
  The news agencies of the solar system broadcast live. State of the art telescopes have a 20 meters resolution over interplanetary distances. They can clearly show the effects of the bombardment on the asteroid. But the telescopes fail to reveal the reason for these excessive military measures.
  A few days later freighters from Venus and Mercury transport additional ordnance to Mukhagni. Commercial mass drivers in Mercury's orbit support the bombardment. Soon, it becomes clear that the mass drivers strive to reduce the asteroid's kinetic energy and angular momentum in order to change its orbit towards the sun.
  After several weeks, Mukhagni's orbit becomes elliptical and the asteroid approaches the Sun. The attacks stop at a distance of ten million kilometers. The kinetic component of the bombardment by mass drivers from Venus and Mercury continues until the orbit finally falls below the Roche-limit where the asteroid breaks apart. Fragments of the asteroid finally fall into the sun.
  The official explanation is a combat exercise, which was supposed to neutralize a kinetic threat (the asteroid) with simultaneous suppressive fire. A test by the Magadha Sangha Federation to protect the population of the inner system in response to the Umvelinqangi incident a few years earlier. However, this does not explain the initial antimatter detonations.
  Actually, Mukhagni was a research facility of Ratha-Musala (the development office) of Ayatashatru (the interplanetary intelligence service) of the Magadha-Sangha (a federation of wealthy Venus habitats). Contrary to the official statement, a secret research project on the asteroid got out of control. The initial amat-detonations were intended to sterilize the asteroid and eliminate the problem. But this did not yield the expected result. The people responsible for the operation saw no other possibility than to plunge the asteroid into the sun (under enormous effort and sustained suppressive fire).
  Of course, the public suspects illegal AI research as happened during the Newplace conspiracy 100 years earlier. Then, the asymptotic development of a gestalt-AI had to be suppressed by a spherical wave of antimatter explosions. In the case of Mukhagni, Ratha-Musala had obviously taken precautions and had installed heavy explosive devices as an emergency measure. This was a lesson from the Newplace experience. Ratha-Musala also had the wisdom to detonate the explosives. But that was apparently not enough. Whatever there was at Mukhagni, it was so powerful that it could withstand even concentrated attacks from several heavy cruisers, their missiles and attack drones.
  But what can be more dangerous than the Newplace AI? There are hints at superior technology. Did an asymptotic AI develope new technologies in a very short time? Or did Ratha-Musala have access to extrasolar technology so early?
  According to another theory, Ratha-Musala experimented with Kessler-Viroidae (discovered by Zipi Kessler, 2478). Supposedly they accidentally activated the disassembler genes of these anorganic viruses (see Massara plague, 2746). If this were true, then the purpose of the nuclear bombardment would have been to sterilize the fragments ejected by kinetic impacts. Correlations between kinetic and nuclear firing sequences support this theory.
  The fact that solar powers conduct secret and sometimes forbidden research projects with outlawed technologies is not surprising. They often use small remote asteroids for this purpose. Asteroids provide more cover from the ubiquitous telescopes than space stations. Over the centuries, several such activities have been uncovered. Mostly by chance, misfortune or by the lack of care on the part of the operators. A restricted area without military activities is a clear sign of secret activities, though not necessarily of illegal projects or banned technologies.
  Ratha-Musala had chosen a volcanoid close to the sun for their research facility on purpose. They also installed antimatter explosives as a precaution. Obviously, they were aware of the risks (that actually speaks against the Kessler-Viroidae theory). Whatever the research topic was, one can assume that it was illegal. 
  In all the history of the interplanetary civilization, only few secret projects get such a high media attention.
