  The Coup of the Space Traders, orchestrated by a coalition of space megacorporations and exiled expansionists, employs illegal exponential microbot swarm mesh technology derived from AI research at the asteroid base Newplace in an attempt to forcibly reopen Earth to space trade. Despite partially succeeding in taking control of key communication hubs and spaceports in South America, the coup faces strong resistance, resulting in a tense stalemate. The conflict is ultimately resolved through the Compromise of Lima, which allows limited reopening of space trade through Santiago and Cordoba, satisfying the demands of Earth's elite for off-world technologies and easing internal dissent, without compromising the planet's broader environmental restoration goals.
  In the wake of Earth's Great Separation of 2284, a growing divide emerged between the planet and the interplanetary civilization. The Neo-Socialist government's decision to withdraw from space development left many feeling betrayed and economically devastated. Orbital conglomerates, once thriving on Earth-based commerce, saw their revenues plummet. Earthbound companies with space-related ventures found themselves cut off from lucrative markets beyond the atmosphere. Scientists, intellectuals, and a significant portion of the general population grew increasingly frustrated with what they perceived as short-sighted policies that ignored the potential benefits of space resources for Earth's restoration.
  The impact of Earth's isolation was particularly severe for the well-off segments of the population. They suddenly lost access to longevity treatments, advanced androidal replacement parts, and cutting-edge automation technologies, including hardware, high-tech eterware, and AI systems produced off-world. This abrupt severance led to a supply chain crisis centered around eterware components, resulting in an estimated loss of about 15% of world GDP over a five-year period.
  The off-world settlements have also been heavily reliant on Earth for nutrients, certain metamaterials as fab input, precision manufacturing of a wide variety of tools and machining equipment, and luxury goods. This dependence persists because, despite the interplanetary economy being highly automated, it lacks the diversity of specialized manufacturing capabilities that Earth possesses.
  The failed Expansionist uprising of 2293 had further polarized the situation. Many wealthy expansionists, disillusioned with Earth's trajectory, chose exile in various off-world habitats. From these new bases of operation, they continued to advocate for Earth's reintegration into the Solar System economy. Their efforts, combined with the ongoing economic pressures and ideological conflicts, set the stage for the events of 2303.
  The so-called Coup of the Space Traders begins on March 15, 2303. A coalition of exiled expansionists, backed by powerful orbital conglomerates and sympathetic elements within Earth's military and economic sectors, orchestrates a coordinated takeover of key computing and communication hubs in South American. The coup is led by Alejandro Vasquez, the CEO of a major orbital produktion conglomerate, and supported by General Maria Alvarez, a high-ranking officer in the South American Defense Alliance who had become disillusioned with Earth's isolationist policies.
  What sets this coup apart from previous attempts is the use of highly advanced and illegal infowar technologies. These systems, derived from exponential AI research conducted at the asteroid base Newplace 12 years prior, had been secured in cold storage but not destroyed. The use of this technology had led to Newplace's expulsion from the Palladian League, but extremist expansionists managed to acquire and deploy these powerful tools during the coup. Subsequently, rumors circulate that the tech wasn't merely the decade-old research results, but rather brand new post-expulsion developments. Such speculation implies that Newplace might have actively supported the coup.
  The coup proceeds in carefully planned stages, although the reality of the operation differed significantly from the public narrative:
  - Net Attack: Advanced AI systems, developed from the illegal Newplace research, launch sophisticated cyberattacks on South American networks using a microbot swarm mesh, temporarily disabling communication and surveillance systems. The public knows about the info-infiltration, but all parties deny the use of infowar technologies beyond the standard tools.
  - Orbital Drop: Contrary to the widely spread misinformation about stealth shuttles with experimental metamaterial cloaking technology, the coup forces used standard drop shuttles. Their descent is effectively concealed by manipulating sensor data from billions of sensors from multiple sources, such as traffic control, earth observation, and military surveillance in all of South America and the southern Pacific. This capability highlights the extent of the infowar technologies deployed.
  - Infrastructure Seizure: The teams quickly secure communication hubs, grok farms and most of the swarm control nodes used by the executive to guarantee peace and order. The success of this phase was largely due to the AI's ability to disable command and control functions in both civilian and military networks. The fact that they were able to infiltrate even shielded military equipment easily is another indication of how superior the Newplace tech really was.
  The coup's success, however, is only partial. While they manage to secure their initial objectives, they face unexpected resistance from the local military. The World Council also quickly mobilizes loyalist forces equipped with advanced drone swarms and electromagnetic pulse weapons developed for terrestrial defense.
  During this period of upheaval, the general public remains largely passive. Most people do not choose sides, instead opting to wait and see how events would unfold. This lack of widespread public support or opposition plays a significant role in the eventual compromise.
  The situation reaches a stalemate when it becomes clear that neither side can achieve a decisive victory without significant bloodshed and destruction of vital infrastructure. The coup forces control the spaceports, major communication hubs, and civic tech control nodes, but loyalist forces have surrounded these areas and control the rest of the urban centers. This impasse, combined with growing public unrest and the threat of economic collapse, forces both sides to the negotiating table.
  The Compromise of Lima, brokered by neutral parties from the Andean Federation, is reached after tense negotiations lasting several weeks. The key points of the compromise include:
  - Restricted Reopening: The spaceports in Santiago and Cordoba are allowed to resume limited operations.
  - Controlled Trade: A new regulatory body, the South American Space Commerce Authority (SASCA), is established to oversee and limit space-based trade.
  - Diplomatic Reengagement: South America is granted observer status in the Solar Coalition.
  - Amnesty Agreement: Coup participants are granted amnesty in exchange for full disclosure of their off-world backing and resources.
  In the aftermath of the compromise, Santiago and Cordoba take on a unique role in Earth's relationship with the rest of the Solar System. These cities and their launch facilities become a safety valve, allowing expansionists to leave Earth if anti-expansionist pressure becomes too high. Simultaneously, they serve as a controlled gateway for limited imports from space. The Earth government occasionally grants import licenses through these spaceports, which helps alleviate pressure from Earth's power brokers and wealthy individuals seeking access to longevity treatments and other space-based technologies produced only in zero-gravity laboratories.
  The limited reopening looks like a partial defeat of Earth's policy, but it is actually the opposite. The World Council and the Gaia Restoration project can easily withstand pressure from interplanetary powers while coping with internal dissent is much more difficult. The Compromise of Lima helps to address the demands of influential people on Earth while its impact is much too small to derail the Gaia Restoration.
