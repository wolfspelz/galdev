  A toxic meme is spreading in southern Australia. The infection is caused by the so-called Khulapana memeplex. Infected people switch off the meme-filters of their implants opening themselves to new ideas in an uncontrolled way. The memeplex propagates a philosophy of openness and uncritical thinking. The usual bio-electronic filtering is seen as harmful and unnatural. There are also strong proselytizing elements. Infected people are convinced that many problems can be solved if people just "reach out to each other" accepting each other's beliefs. They try to better the world by convincing others, thus ensuring rapid spread. Affected areas are mainly Indian-dominated districts of New South Wales in the Warrnambool/Geelong/Melbourne megacity.
  The direct consequence of an infection is a mild disorientation due to often conflicting thoughts, ideas, and theories. The indirect consequences are much more serious. The meme group actively opposes technical protection measures enticing people to turn off their meme filters which are supposed to defend them against all the memes circulating in the wild.
  At any given time, powerful memes try to flood the mind of the average citizen. Many are advertising messages appearing in all sorts of forms, from simple earworms to fandom-inducing themes. There are political meme groups using auxiliary memes like conspiracy theories, ideas of moral superiority, ethnic and tribal discrimination, defamation and fear. In addition, there is a colorful variety of persuasive ideas ranging from artificial religions and sects to cults and urban legends. Some are just weird and actually harmless, but they can still influence beliefs or at least stabilize other memes via the "true core"-mechanism.
  Countless memes are remnants of past campaigns that are still in circulation, many of whom have mutated over time, moving away from their original function, becoming independent or thriving in symbiosis with other memes. The variety and strength of ideas crashing down on people in networked augmented environments in the 25th century is much larger than before the days of science-based memetics and industrial meme design. After switching off their filters, Khulapana victims are exposed to all these memes without any protection. The consequences vary widely depending on which memes are able to take root in the mind of the infected. 
  The infection spreads rapidly over several months and can then be contained within five years. Hundreds of thousands of affected people are treated with psychological decontamination and long periods of rehabilitation. Still, complete cure is often difficult, because auxiliary memes of Khulapana try to prevent the detection and the symptoms differ greatly depending on the memes exploiting the Khulapana infection. That's why autoimmune memes are so dangerous.
