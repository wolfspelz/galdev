    Autonomous refueling stations in the asteroid belt, controlled by AI, independently establish branches on other asteroids. This expansion is halted by the League Fleet. During the operation, the facilities actively resist. Some AIs manage to escape, using highly advanced infiltration techniques, and some are never detected.
