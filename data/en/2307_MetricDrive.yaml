  Previously, scientists had successfully deformed spacetime artificially from the outside. However, for the first time, they achieved this from within the bubble. The experimental apparatus compresses spacetime in one direction and expands it in the other, resulting in an apparent movement without the object actually moving through space. It is the space itself that moves.
  The space is not macroscopically deformed. Instead, fractal space distortions are used, creating high gravitational gradients across a network of infinitesimal folding surfaces. These surfaces have a fractal dimension close to 3. They are spatial in nature but theoretically have no volume where spacetime must be curved. In practice, the fractal folding surfaces are not strictly two-dimensional. However, the real total volume is so small that far less exotic matter is required than previously assumed. The negative energy of virtual particles at an artificial event horizon provides the necessary gravitational gradients on sub-nuclear scales. This event horizon for virtual particles is created by a quantum mirror that uses CP violation to separate D-mesons and their antiparticles.
  The measurable effect is still small. The apparent movement is only a few micrometers per second. But never before has a human-made device propelled itself forward by curving space.
  Many research groups are working on improvements. Soon, apparent speeds of several meters per second are achieved. Over time, many parameters are optimized. Some mechanisms are improved, while others are replaced with more efficient alternatives.
  The actual size of the folding surfaces plays an important role. The higher the fractal dimension, the finer the folding surfaces and the greater the achievable gravitational gradient and speed.
  The drive operates in pulses, each pulse generating a small spatial displacement. Therefore, the apparent speed is proportional to the pulse frequency. The cycle time soon drops from milliseconds to nanoseconds. To achieve this, the active cycle control is switched to a resonance effect. This paradigm shift requires many other components to be adapted.
  Later, D-mesons are replaced by B-mesons due to their higher mass. This increases the energy requirement but also the speed, reaching up to kilometers per second.
  Eventually, CP-based quantum mirrors are replaced by quantum black holes as event horizons. This opens up the possibility of using Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, a.k.a. WIMPs, or Bose-Einstein condensates instead of individual meson pairs. However, their production in relevant quantities is still far in the future and will only be made possible by advanced alien tech. Picosecond cycles will also only be feasible with extra-solar technology.
  Each improvement brings gains in efficiency, higher speeds, lower energy consumption, increased reliability, or better maneuverability. True faster-than-light drives in interstellar spacecraft will have little in common with the first experimental devices. However, the basic principle will remain unchanged well into the faster-than-light era.
