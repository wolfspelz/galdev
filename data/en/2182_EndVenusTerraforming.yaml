    The termination of the ambitious Venus Terraforming Project in 2182 marks a turning point in the journey of human colonization of other planets. The Venus Initiative for Terraforming and Environmental Research (VITER), a.k.a. the Venus Project, a consortium of international entities, faced a growing tide of criticism over its continual failures to achieve significant milestones. The project's ambitious aim to render Venus habitable had captured the imagination of scientists, engineers, and the public, but in the end, insurmountable obstacles led to its unfortunate discontinuation.
    The Venus Project's undertaking comprised a series of challenging sub-projects, each aimed at a unique aspect of Venus's extreme environment. Atmospheric Management sought to tackle the thick, carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere, aiming to mitigate the planet's potent greenhouse effect. Another sub-project, the Solar Radiation Shield Construction, had the goal of shielding Venus from excess solar radiation, given the planet's proximity to the Sun. Parallel to these efforts, the Planetary Albedo Modification project was designed to increase Venus's reflectivity, thereby decreasing the amount of solar heat absorbed by the planet. Similarly, the Synthetic Magnetosphere Development aimed to establish an artificial magnetosphere, compensating for Venus's lack of a natural magnetic field to protect against solar wind and radiation.
    Despite the pioneering spirit and advanced technology driving these initiatives, they were beset with a variety of setbacks. Venus's overall temperature remained stubbornly high, refusing to decrease significantly over decades. Additionally, bioengineered microbes, which were introduced as a key tool for transforming the hostile environment, proved far more fragile than expected. Their failure to reproduce in the necessary quantities led to a continuous cycle of replenishment, which proved to be an unsustainable strategy.
    Further challenges arose with the Solar Radiation Shield, which turned out to be a significantly costlier endeavor than originally projected. Despite attempts to utilize existing infrastructure from Earth's sun shade project, the costs kept ballooning, leading to a strain on the project's budget. The dimensions of the project were underestimated. Ultimately, Earth's sunshades were constructed only a million kilometers away from Earth using lunar materials. From Earth's perspective, the "Solar Radiation Shield" for Venus was 40 times further away and for a long time, no local asteroids were available as sources of raw materials.
    On the bright side, the Robotic Construction and Mining sub-project, despite facing the harsh realities of Venus's conditions, was making steady progress. Even though Venus's extreme conditions expedited equipment wear and tear, causing delays, a good workaround was found by incorporating asteroids moved into Venus orbit as additional sources for resource extraction as soon as the technology became feasible.
    The conclusion of the Venus Terraforming Project went widely unnoticed by the general public, as they perceived the project to be a distant dream. Throughout its course, the project had consistently promised tangible outcomes that were always projected to be 50 years away in the future, even at a time when the project had been running for almost 100 years. If anything, the public is content with the funds being freed up.
    However, the interplanetary workforce experiences significant ripple effects, impacting roughly 10% of all jobs related to space activities. Fortunately, these skilled individuals swiftly secure alternative positions within Earth-Moon space, thereby alleviating the labour shortage affecting the rapidly growing volume of space-based operations during that period.
    Looking back, it is clear that the formation of VITER – and it's prolonging even when problems and cost overruns were undeniable – was significantly influenced by scientists and politicians eager to captivate the public with a far-reaching and visionary project. For numerous scientists and engineers, the project represented a lifetime's worth of work. For the participating companies, it provided decades of lucrative contracts. Meanwhile, politicians globally used it as justification for massive expenditures. The comprehensive media coverage of the terraforming project successfully shifted public attention towards a distant future objective. At times, the reports even managed to divert focus from actual issues by touting supposed breakthroughs in the Venus Project.
    The discontinuation marks a significant shift in strategy towards the construction of habitats, both floating ones and orbital habitats. Rather than transforming an entire planet, which is both time-consuming and technologically challenging, orbital habitats – and specifically in case of Venus, floating habitats – provide a more incremental approach that delivers tangible results much sooner. In fact, these habitats are viewed as the future of human habitation on Venus. Now, the emphasis has shifted to developing floating habitats in the upper atmosphere where conditions of air pressure, temperature, and gravity closely resemble those on Earth. The legacy of the Venus Terraforming Project still has its merits, though. The infrastructure left behind in Venus orbit, including small asteroids for mining, becomes a significant asset in the construction of floating habitats in Venus's upper atmosphere.
