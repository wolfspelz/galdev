    The year 2248 witnesses one of the most catastrophic events in space exploration history: the obliteration of Gemini, the colossal double cylinder situated at the Earth-Moon Lagrange point L5. 
    By the mid-23rd century, Gemini has grown into a bustling cluster of habitats with a population of more than 40,000. Its twin-cylinder main structure represents a pinnacle of space engineering, offering an Earth-like environment and a thriving cultural and economic hub in space. 
    Then, in an instant, it is all gone, transformed into a cloud of debris and a tragic testament to the fragility of human endeavors in the vastness of space.
    The research into Quantum Chromodynamics color charge separation conducted by Hwanin Dachaeloun Gwahag, meaning "Colorful Science", a decentralized scientific organization (DSO), played a pivotal role in the unfolding of this catastrophic event. At its L5 research facility, Hwanin DSO was laying the scientific groundwork for an energy storage device harnessing the strong nuclear force. Their experiments focused on so-called quark polarizers, which, in simple terms, separate the color charges in a gluon-ball akin to a charged electrical capacitor. Despite numerous challenges, color charge separation holds the potential for a revolutionary shift in energy storage technology.
    The rationale for conducting these experiments in space was to escape the Earth's pervasive vibrations and mechanical shocks, which could disrupt the delicate metastable equilibrium of the color charge polarizers. On Earth, even minor tremors or distant trucks can cause sub-atomic-scale displacements, smaller than an atomic nucleus, rendering such high-precision experiments unfeasible.
    However, the disaster unfolded due to a gross underestimation of the impacts of moving masses in the space environment, particularly those associated with a vast space station like Gemini. Hwanin DSO preferred the advanced industrial manufacturing environment of Gemini over a more remote and significantly more expensive research outpost. This decision, driven by economic considerations, overlooked the potential risks associated with conducting such high-stakes experiments in a dynamic space colony.
    There were early critics who warned that even small gravitational effects could disrupt the delicate setup of the QCD experiment, e.g.: Smith, J., & Zhang, L. "Gravitational Perturbations in Zero-G High-Energy Experiments: A Neglected Risk?" Journal of Space Physics, 2247. In this report, the authors underscore the risks associated with high-energy physics experiments in dynamic space habitats like Gemini, teeming with industrial activity and situated near significant masses. They point out that even minor gravitational disturbances can disrupt experimental setups in zero-gravity environments. These disturbances risk being amplified by the strong nuclear force, potentially leading to significant energy releases and instabilities. The report advocates for heightened safety measures and a reassessment of experimental locations to mitigate these risks.
    Dr. Zhang in an interview: "They're playing with fire. It's not just about failing experiments; it's about igniting a catastrophe," and "These habitats are powder kegs. It's like juggling dynamite in a room full of lit fuses."
    Even citizens noticed these experiments: an inquiry to the Gemini B Council from a concerned citizen: "Dear City Council, my name is Bao Nguyen, I'm 7 years old and live in Gemini B. I've noticed that there are a lot of fusion reactors at business area 3, and they seem to be running all the time. I'm curious where all the energy is going? I'm also worried if this is safe for all of us living here in our space home. Thank you, Bao". The Council’s response: "Dear Bao, thank you for your question about the fusion reactors. We asked the company responsible for these reactors, and they assured us that everything is okay."
    Nevertheless, these warnings were overshadowed by financial considerations and the widespread assumption that the enormous scale difference between the nuclear forces involved, and gravitational effects would eliminate any negative consequences. The disparity is staggering, with nuclear forces being approximately 10^39 times stronger than gravity - a difference not just in thousands, or even millions, but in the realm of a thousand trillion trillion trillion times. With such a colossal disparity, it seemed inconceivable that the weaker force could ever significantly impact the stronger one. What could possibly go wrong?
    The company's stance was further bolstered by the argument that the technology, to be commercially successful, needed to function efficiently in dynamic environments. The development of this technology in the seclusion of a distant outpost was considered to be counterproductive, as it would fail to replicate the real-world conditions where the technology would ultimately be applied.
    As it transpired, the issue was not the scale difference itself, but rather the destabilizing effects of gravitational disturbances from nearby masses. These minor disturbances were significantly magnified due to the scale difference, turning what was presumed to be a safeguard into the primary issue. Thus, the very factor thought to offer protection ironically became the main source of the problem.
    The continuous space traffic, operational dynamics of the habitats, and the gravitational influence of nearby resource asteroids, created an environment far from the anticipated stability. These subtle but cumulative gravitational effects of movements in space, previously considered inconsequential, critically destabilized the QCD experiments. The company's decision to prioritize economic efficiency and the commercial potential of the technology, while dismissing the scientific concerns raised, ultimately led to a catastrophic oversight.
    Compounding this miscalculation was the intense pressure from investors and management for demonstrable progress. The research, lagging behind schedule, was under scrutiny. In a bid to accelerate results, the company leadership opted for a daring experimental run, seeking to demonstrate significant advancements instead of a small increment. Powerful fusion reactors had been continuously adding energy to the experiment over several months, stretching the safety margins as safety concerns were sidelined. Citing chairwoman Adeola Tran-Nguyen: "Let’s be bold". 
    The destruction commenced with the inadvertent destabilization of the polarizers. This destabilization rapidly escalated into a catastrophic chain reaction. The color charges, in their quest for equilibrium, recombined explosively, unleashing the accumulated energy in a devastating burst. The initial explosion at the research facility generated a destructive shockwave, shattering the colony's infrastructure and causing immediate, widespread calamity.
    The explosion, with energy comparable to a small nuclear detonation, obliterated the twin cylinders of Gemini including its once-thriving ecosystems and communities. Without prior warning and in mere milliseconds, the pride of human space colonization was reduced to a tragic debris field, floating silently in the vacuum of space.
    By chance Bao and his class were physically visiting the outer pharms when the disaster struck making him the only survivor of the blended multi-gen Nguyen household at Gemini-B.
    Technical Appendix:
    QCD's depiction of quarks and gluons interacting through color charges is just an approximation. While it sufficiently models the physics needed for energy storage using color charge separation – a process relatively low in energy on the sub-nucleonic scale – it does not account for certain critical effects that manifest at higher energy levels. 
    The notion of physically separating color charges is a misconception, as the energy within the force field inevitably generates new particle-antiparticle pairs, nullifying both the separation and the stored energy. The process, in reality, involves dynamically altering the wave function of color charges, resulting in an "imaginary" separation. This is then rotated in phase space to manifest as a minor effective real separation. 
    Owing to the limitations of traditional Lattice QCD, which is too coarse for this application, a novel computational method was necessary. The start of color charge separation research coincided with the development of an analytical solver for non-linear differential equations, enabling precise computations. 
    The so-called 'quark polarizer' does not actually polarize quarks, especially not those bound within baryons. It primarily interacts with a gluon plasma, briefly stabilized by inhibiting certain decay-paths. This is achieved through the Chukwuma Effect, which transforms quarks into carriers of a pseudo-force among gluon-balls. By blocking specific decay channels, the polarization of these quarks temporarily stabilizes the gluon balls, enabling the establishment of color charge separation for a duration that is practical for applications.
    Ironically, the term "quark polarizer" is quite misleading, yet it has gained traction in popular science as a way to analogize color charge separation to the well-known charge separation in electrical capacitors. While polarized quarks are indeed involved in color charge separation, the nature of this polarization is fundamentally different from what the term might suggest (chirality, not separation). Despite this, the terminology has persisted, leading to the widespread use of the phrases "quark polarizers" and "color charge capacitors".
    In the intricate realm of Quantum Chromodynamics color charge separation, the stabilization of the quark polarizers poses a significant challenge. Active control mechanisms were initially developed with the intent to stabilize these polarizers. These mechanisms attempted to dynamically adjust the system in response to minute changes in the environment or the polarizer's own state. However, due to the small scale and immense strength of the strong nuclear force, active control proved to be a daunting, often futile, endeavor. The strong force, governing the interactions between quarks and gluons, operates at such small scales and with such intensity that any active control mechanism struggles to respond adequately and in time to maintain stability. The complexity and rapidity of the interactions within the polarizers exceeded the capabilities of active control systems, making them ineffective for practical, safe applications.
    It was only much later, with the development of a passive control cycle, that QCD charge separators began to show promise for practical use. This breakthrough came in the form of a self-regulating feedback loop, a system inherently designed to maintain equilibrium without the need for external adjustments. This passive approach leveraged the natural dynamics of strong force interactions, allowing the system to respond to fluctuations intrinsically. By aligning with the inherent properties of the strong nuclear force, rather than attempting to counteract them, this passive control cycle provided a more reliable and stable method of managing the color charge separators. As a result, QCD charge separators eventually became stable enough for practical applications, marking a significant advancement in the field of high-energy physics and energy storage technologies.
