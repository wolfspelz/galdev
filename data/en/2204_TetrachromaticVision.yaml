  Neuroscientists discover that most people can process four basic colors in their brain instead of only known three. The ability to distinguish four primary colors is known from many animals. It is called tetrachromatic vision. Full tetrachromatic vision requires four types of receptors and the appropriate processing capability in the brain. It seems that humans lost one of the four receptor types, the one in the close UV band, in the course of evolution while the brain's processing capability only went dormant.
  In fact, some people still have residues of the fourth receptor on the X chromosome. However, the signals are only processed correctly by very few people. While the receptors are missing, the processing brain areas are still present even in most unmodified humans. However, they can be activated by neuroimplants, so that close UV can now be seen as new color, called "brisk". This leads to a much richer color sensation.
  Most people already use augmented reality through bio-electronic implants. The AI of the implants overlays virtual objects and supports their users with context information. Meme-filters and child-comps also modify the vision to hide what people do not want to see or should not see. 
  All these virtual augmentation displays now also employ the fourth basic color.
  Just ten years later, the new color "brisk" – and all its mixed colors with blue, green, and red – are an integral part of everyday life.
