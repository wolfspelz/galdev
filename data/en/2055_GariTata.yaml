    Since the 1940s, cars really have been driving independently. This works not only on straight stretches and motorways, but also everywhere in the cities, in all weathers, day and night. If you need a vehicle, you can call one. In the city, it takes no more than five minutes for a car to arrive at the door. It drives from the nearest location on its own, takes the passengers to their destination by itself, and then continues alone on to the next job. 
    Fewer and fewer cars are sold to private individuals. The total number of cars is decreasing. In the past, cars were parked usually on the street in front of the house. Today they are in constant use. The resource car is more widely used. Fewer units are needed. The car industry, which has now assimilated the switch to electric drive, is facing an even bigger problem. In the mid-40s, a wave of mergers takes place. Car manufacturers combine or are taken over by car rental companies. 
    Vehicle manufacturers who timely relied on rental cars are becoming modern mobility providers with their own production of hardware. Other transportation providers are buying vehicle manufacturers to extend the longevity of created value. High availability of vehicles is crucial. Transportation providers must therefore offer a large carpool. At the same time, the providers must have strong presence nationwide. After all, even for individual trips between cities, only the distance used can be invoiced, even if the car must travel back a long way afterwards. This leads to a combination of transportation providers created through some of the largest company mergers of all time. 
    In 2050 or thereabouts, the transport market is to be dominated by only a few providers. One of them is Gari Tata, which emerged from mobility platforms GariGari and Tata Motors. Gari Tata has 1.6 billion customers worldwide, of which 900 million are fixed subscribers and almost 100 million own vehicles. Customers today spend on average only 5% of their income on transport. Nevertheless, the turnover of Gari Tata is equivalent to the gross domestic product of a large EU member state. 
    Like all mobility companies, Gari Tata also offers various contracts, with a fixed term or monthly time of notice, with fixed range quotas or depending on usage. There are various quality classes from a small car to sports convertible. As is usual in the industry, the tariff system includes bonus programs, point systems, cross-selling of other infrastructure offers and combination tariffs for integrated communication, information/entertainment, and mobile services (KEM flats). Most customers have usage-based tariffs. Invoicing is automatically calculated by time and kilometers via the user's mobile appendage (smart button, earring, bracelet, e-paper, Nili, spectacles). 
    In 2052, Urban Professional magazine from the San Diego Megaplex reviews the performance of several transport providers with road tests. In the process, all the companies tested show deviations between the estimated distance and the distance invoiced. The deviations range between 1% and 3%. This is not surprising, as a tolerance of 3% is permitted in most countries. The deviation is regularly measured and published by many bodies. The corresponding charging factor is taken into account by price comparison platforms. Only Gari Tata stands out with a discrepancy of 4%. This should be impossible, because the test laboratories of the monitoring agencies would not certify the service in this way. Urban Professional publishes the test result of Gari Tata as a statistical outsider.
    There are constant reports on the quality, performance, and the cost of transport providers worldwide. As early as 2053, Gari Tata's service again shows an above-average discrepancy in a comparison by Mumumi (Mumbai Municipal Minute – news by the minute). After several press reports, the Indian transport authority has TÜV Bangalore conduct intensive laboratory, road, and simulator tests. It turns out that Gari Tata's calculations on the test bench and in the simulator are correct and in road tests only wrong under certain conditions. After further investigations, the assumption is made that the accounting algorithm made a distinction between test and real conditions.
    Gari Tata seems to use different mileages depending on whether actual driving is taking place, or a test is in progress. Only real final customers are expected to have an up to 6% higher mileage. Apparently, the billing system also compares customer profiles and account names with external databases. Even with freelancers from transport magazines who use the user account of family members, no inconsistencies are noticeable. The billing software evidently goes to great lengths to distinguish real driving from test drives and to conceal the different calculation.
    After a shit storm in the media, Gari Tata explains that different mileage figures apply to inspections, as real distances cannot be measured during laboratory tests on the test bench. The Indian traffic authority accepts the explanation and stops the investigations after a successful retest.
    The consumer watchdogs however are not so easily turned away. Gari Tata's announcement has obvious gaps, as not only laboratory tests are affected. Gradually, independent testers succeed in proving the miscalculation in a way they can reproduce.
    At the beginning of 2054, the deviations suddenly vanish. Apparently Gari Tata had disconnected the manipulation with a worldwide update of the software. Only in a few simulators without a network connection the error remains measurable. Due to this obvious intervention, regulatory authorities in several countries become aware of the problem. Investigations begin. There are inquiries into the company, searches, interrogations, and seizure of evidence. The media report in detail. Business from new customer collapses. 
    In mid-2054 Gari Tata admits to the manipulation. The software service provider of a supplier to the Malaysian private customer subsidiary of the group had developed an invoicing algorithm that optimizes customer lifetime value. The selection of the service provider by the supplier was based on a cost-benefit analysis without the employees of Gari Tata having been notified of any unauthorized manipulation. Unfortunately, the software component of the subsidiary company later found its way into the operating components of vehicles worldwide.
    The elaborate measures for concealment in the invoicing software and in the logs of software updates make the explanation seemingly implausible. The turnover falls by 10%.
    Customers with especially short contracts switch to other providers. In most regions of the globe, several companies compete for the transport budget of customers. The performance is so standardized that the offers differ mainly in price and service. Switching over is not difficult.
    Consumer lawsuits and reclamations are filed against the company in over 150 countries.
    Related enquiries lead to further investigations. It emerges there was involvement in the manipulation on many levels. Those responsible and those involved are on the GT Holding Executive Board, in product management and sales, development and maintenance, and among suppliers and regional subsidiaries. In around 100 countries, the public prosecutor's office is filing charges. Sales fall by 20%.
    Most of Gari Tata's profits are in countries with favorable tax conditions. The group had issued corporate bonds to distribute profits to shareholders without having to pay high income taxes on financial transfers. This practice has been going on for several years. Bonds in the amount of one year's turnover are offset by untaxed credits of 120%.
    In 2055, foreign assets are repatriated at a loss. This is not happening fast enough. The holding company can no longer service all the loans. The share price plummets.
    Bonds become overdue and payable. A forecast shows a significant shortfall of tax-adjusted assets compared to liabilities. The share price plunges into a bottomless pit. In at least 50 countries, the Group is sentenced to fines. The total amount is 80% of an annual turnover. Senior employees are indicted. Extraordinary contract terminations by existing customers cause a 50% drop in sales.
    In early 2056, the holding company declares insolvency. Many regional companies follow. Operations are discontinued. All customers change. Sales of the vehicle fleet are sluggish.
    A few years later Gari Tata is removed from the company register.
    The head of the Indian Transport Authority is under investigation for illegally accepting benefits. A further 80 employees of the agency are dismissed.
    In over 50 states, over 300 Gari Tata employees are convicted of fraud, about 150 of conspiracy, 99 of organized crime and three in Bhutan of grossly negligent reduction of gross national happiness.
    In more than 70 countries around the world, connections between tax amnesties and Gari Tata lobbyists are revealed. In total, two ministers and five members of parliament resign globally.
    Consumer watchdog NGOs (independent NGOs) are also uncovering optimization at other transport providers that allow higher-than-average customer lifetime values. It is revealed that some other providers have only slightly more in their defense regarding manipulating invoices than Gari Tata and more importantly, in tests the appliance of better algorithms is detected.
