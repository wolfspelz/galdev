  After 500 years of abuse and self-reinforcing climate degradation, the biosphere begins to recover.
  The Batafurai index (Japanese: butterfly) calculates the quality of the biosphere in relation to the ideal state, taking into account long-term trends. The index now rises for the first time in half a millennium. This means that the earth is slowly recovering. 
  Since the beginning of industrialization the Batafurai index has been falling. The condition of nature, the environment and climate patterns have been deteriorating. Several centuries of pollution and overexploitation have led to a self-reinforcing stress on the biosphere, a so-called runaway effect. This development had accelerated in the 23rd century when Antarctica, the northern permafrost, and the deep oceans reacted only after long delays. Many parts of the biosphere entered into equilibria unfavorable to humans. 
  Under the Earth Union's neo-socialist government, the Kubadwanso program (Bantu/Chewa: born again) begins in 2350 with the goal of rehabilitating Earth. Many problems of the biosphere are addressed in a worldwide concerted effort over several decades. Solar radiation is reduced to lower global temperatures and greenhouse gases are sequestered from the atmosphere. There is a plethora of measures to restore the environment and pristine nature. Large rainforests are being regrown. Biotopes are reconstructed through genetic engineering and natural food chains are reestablished. These largescale environmental projects are supported by a new type of "full-effect" accounting ensuring more sustainable economic activity.
  All these measures clearly have an effect: the deterioration of the environment is slowing down. The downward trend comes to a halt. Finally, the turnaround is achieved. A hundred years later, the Batafurai index has grown by 20%. There are clear signs that the equilibria shift again in favor of a healthy biosphere. It is expected that another 200 years later the Batafurai index might reach the level of the year 2050. Further increase to pre-industrial levels does not seem possible, as parts of the environment, life forms, and resources are lost forever.
  Earth is well on its way when external developments change priorities. After the Unification War practically ends the Earth Union and the new government in Calcutta takes over, the earth rejoins the Solar Coalition becoming expansionist. The people of Earth can now see their future among the stars again. However, they are no more willing to limit themselves to renewable resources nor are they eager to continue the expensive rehabilitating efforts of the previous neo-socialist government. Unfortunately, this means that the Kubadwanso program, suspended during the Unification War, is not resumed.
