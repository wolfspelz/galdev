    In 2158, the Peace Corps is thrust into an escalating conflict between competing commercial ventures on the Moon. These corporate rivals, supported by hired mercenaries, have been engaged in a tense standoff for years over valuable lunar resources. When the situation turns violent, the Peace Corps is called upon to intervene, marking its first mission on the lunar surface. The Peace Corps assembles a ragtag team of brave individuals. They face a unique challenge: enforcing peace in the stark, low-gravity environment of the Moon with neither the equipment nor the training designed for such a scenario.
    The lunar surface becomes an eerie battlefield, its tranquility disrupted by a silent but intense conflict. The Peace Corps team navigates the unique conditions, operating in restrictive spacesuits and adapting to low-gravity combat. They intervene forcefully, demonstrating Earth's intolerance for off-world hostilities. The peacekeepers' firm stance, backed by their readiness to use force, effectively brings the violent conflict to a halt. However, this success comes at a price: five mercenaries and one Peace Corps member lose their lives in the action.
    The intervention’s aftermath sees a crucial development in space law enforcement: the formation of the Peace Corps' Space Patrol. This dedicated unit, specifically trained and equipped for off-world operations, stands as a direct response to the Moon conflict. 
    Over the years the Space Patrol grows and expands as a multinational peacekeeping force specialized for off-world operations. Response team are usually quite small. They are specifically trained and equipped for engagements in outer space, in earth orbit, in habitats, on the moon and beyond. 
    The ad-hoc team drawn up in 2158 for the first moon mission goes down into history as Team-Zero. Members of Team-Zero become the face of the Space Patrol. These are the pioneering individuals who set the course for future peacekeeping operations in space:
    - Major Olivia 'Liv' Moreno: A seasoned peacekeeper with years of service on Earth, Liv finds herself leading the untested Team-Zero. Despite the lack of specific training, her strategic prowess and adaptability make her an effective leader in the hostile lunar environment.
    - Lieutenant Max 'Astro' Astrovski: A former commercial and military spaceflight pilot. Astro takes the team to the target area. His experience in the operation of spaceships, shuttles and military technology is invaluable. He is the team's specialist for navigation, transport, and logistics.
    - Sergeant Zara 'Doc' Khan: A medic with experience in conflict zones, Doc's ability to improvise medical treatments in the low-gravity environment saves several lives, including those of the mercenaries they were sent to stop fighting.
    - Mr. Noah Grimaldi: An experienced peacekeeper with a knack for deescalation. He uses his skills to defuse several potential flashpoints during the mission. His bravery under fire contributes significantly to the team's survival. He can prevent the conflict from spreading to other moon stations and he ultimately convinces the conflicting parties to stop fighting.
    - Specialist Hiro 'Tech' Takashi: A former tech consultant for various lunar mining companies, Hiro's knowledge of the lunar infrastructure and resource extraction technologies proves invaluable. He plays a crucial role in sabotaging the mercenaries' operation.
    - PFC Evie 'Rookie' LeBlanc: The youngest member of the team and a recent recruit to the Peace Corps, Evie grew up in zero gravity. She has a natural absolute orientation and specialized in 0G combat tactics and technique from an early age. That's why she joins the team despite her youth. Tragically, she loses her life in the mission, becoming the first Peace Corps casualty in space.
    Her courage and sacrifice play a crucial role in the creation of the Space Patrol. Despite this loss, Team-Zero's intervention on the moon is considered a success. It lays the foundation for future peacekeeping missions in space ensuring a safer future for off-world commercial and scientific ventures.
    Other notable missions:
