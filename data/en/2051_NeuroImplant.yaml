    Micromechanical Neuro-Implant. Chengdu, China.
    The only surviving model of the Series-H optic nerve adapter of a micromechanical AV neuro-implant from the Chengdu Center for Medical Technology.
    The implant feeds artificial signals into visual and auditory nerves. It originates from the 22nd clinical trial series, which was initially aimed at helping blind and deaf people. The device consists of five components, two of each for visual and auditory nerves and a central control module. The elements are each about five millimeters in size. They are placed in the target regions of the head during an operation, largely minimally invasive.
    After the surgical installation, microfibers connect to the local neurons. In contrast to modern Nano-implants, this is done with a "shoot first, ask later" approach, i.e. all neurons are connected and only then analyzed. The connection phase is followed by the calibration period in which the function of the neurons is tested. A priori, the functions of individual neurons and bundles of neurons are not known. With the calibration, neurons (and combinations of neurons) are assigned to visual field elements (pixels) and frequencies.
    An essential innovation of the eighth series (Model-H) was the autarkic system without an external power supply and without a battery. The devices are powered by chemical micro-reactors that take blood sugar from the bloodstream. The implant is supplied with data wirelessly.
    In addition to the power supply, the resolution was also groundbreaking. The entire field of view had 300k pixels plus 50k pixels in the focal point. This made it possible to create images with up to 600 pixels or to fade in corresponding schematic drawings and texts over the natural image.
    Micromechanical Neuro-implants were the forerunners of Nano-implants, which later enabled the use of "Slinks" (sensory links), i.e. the recording and reproduction of sensory perceptions up to the point of full simulation.
