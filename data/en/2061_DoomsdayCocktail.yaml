    A range of samples from waste-water lakes of pharmaceutical production northeast of Hyderabad, India.
    It is the deadliest cocktail of aggressive highly resistant germs that has ever existed, the so-called Doomsday Cocktail.
    By the middle of the century, 10 million die from multi-resistant germs every year. In the meantime, aggressive bacteria appear that are resistant to any kind of last-resort antibiotics. Excessive use of antibiotics in medicine is a major driving force of this development. The problem is that in many countries even for small infections highly effective broad-spectrum antibiotics of the latest generation are administered. These antibiotics should be reserved as drugs of last resort. However, pharmaceutical companies are keen on selling these products to get a good return on their investment. Doctors want to do their best to cure diseases and patients often prefer better, newer, and stronger drugs for themselves. Even though this causes problems for all of humanity in the long run. 
    Industrial meat production has also played its part. The standard use of antibiotics as a supplement to farm animal feed serves as a training ground where microbes can optimize their resistances over many decades. Particularly spectacular are unintended breeder reactors of the pharmaceutical industry: stagnant waters where wastewater is discharged. Environmental standards are low in India and China, where a large part of the world's antibiotics is produced. So uncleared production residues are discharged into rivers and lakes in many places. There, antibiotics accumulate. 
    The lakes northeast of Hyderabad is one such region where bodies of water have not had a natural outlet for 30 years. The amount of rain has decreased due to climate change. The water levels are too low. Therefore, the water seeps away or evaporates. In some areas this has been going on for 40 years. There are bodies of waters with huge concentrations of all kinds of antibiotics that can only be produced in a laboratory.
    This would not be a problem, because theoretically, the antibiotics kill all microbes. There is no life possible. In fact, individual microbes survive and develop resistances through natural selection. These microbes continue to mutate and multiply. This is the well-known process of developing resistances. The development is becoming dramatic because the concentration of antibiotics has continued to rise over the past 40 years. As the water evaporates, the antibiotics remain. New wastewater comes in and leaves residues behind when it evaporates. This unwanted slow increase of antibiotic exposure over decades has been ideal for breeding super bacteria. Incurable germs that, if released in a big city, would trigger a rapid global pandemic. 
    Some particularly dangerous lakes have now been covered by concrete domes so that the microbes are not spread by birds, insects, or other animals. Unfortunately, with limited resources the authorities were forced to focus on the worst cases. The WHO took countless samples of contaminated water and soil.
    Samples with most dangerous microbes living despite the highest concentrations of antibiotics are stored in a high-security laboratory of the IEIS (India Epidemic Intelligence Service): the doomsday cocktail.
