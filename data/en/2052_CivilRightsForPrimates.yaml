    Iceland is the first nation to officially recognize apes as people. Some specifically selected species of apes are given the same rights as those afforded to young children. Thereby they theoretically attain human rights. Foremost they get the protection of personal rights (life, physical integrity) and the right to freedom. If necessary, they are appointed a spokesperson to safeguard their rights. In practice, in individual cases their rights need to be contested in court. But if a spokesperson for a chimpanzee makes a case for him not to be caged, then chances are high  that a court grants the request based on its right to self-determination. 
    The law is very far-reaching. With the new classification for primates, other animals are being upgraded as well. Some other species that show high cognitive abilities are not classified as persons but acknowledged as non-human entities. Included in this category are octopus, elephants, dolphins, some whales, wolves, dogs, and certain pets. These animals are no longer to be considered as "things", but rather as "beings", a new legal order of entities aside people and things. Hence individuals of these species are no longer automatically the property of any person. 
    A permanent commission is established, to decide the choices of species. The commission consists of delegates from various social groups. It evaluates self-recognition, social behavior, planning skills, the ability to speak (through sounds or sign language), to recognize cause and effect, innovation, imitation and learning behavior. 
    The Icelandic parliament the Althing explicitly states that only new data acquired by purely scientific means (i.e.: observation hypothesis tests) may be presented for discussions at the commission. Specifically excluded are arguments based on traditional and commercial interests, such as "it's always been that way…. our ancient writings said it" or "it's not affordable". In 2062 – against resistance from the meat industry – farm animals are to be included. This will in effect render illegal the farming of pigs to produce meat. 
    "How should we relate to beings who look into mirrors and see themselves as individuals, who mourn companions and may die of grief, who have a consciousness of 'self'? Don't they deserve to be treated with the same sort of consideration we accord to other highly sensitive beings: ourselves" - Jane Goodall
    It was a long way from the banning of fur farms, battery cages, animal testing for cosmetics at the start of the 21st century until the first recognition of animals as persons by a ruling state. There have also been single cases whereby the rights of animals were addressed. In India animals are already long protected as "beings" (rather than "things"). Animals also obtained rights in Germany, which in practice however, often had to take a back seat to commercial interests. In the twenties and thirties, the movement for animal rights (NHR – ‘Non-Human Rights') gained much support. Scandinavia, New Zealand, Bhutan, and Ecuador introduced animal rights, as well as bans on exploitation and animal abuse. In the forties they were joined by many other countries and autonomous regions. 
    Ultimately, a realization prevails that humanity is not defined as either one way or the other, but rather a continuum of cognitive and social skills. That chimpanzees are as intelligent, self-confident, and compassionate as human children. That we do not deny humanity to people with limited abilities and that it is not harmful to humans if they protect fellow beings in the same way as fellow human beings worth protecting. 
    After Iceland other Scandinavian and European countries followed suit with a full recognition of the personal rights of primates. 
    During the following 20 years, a further 50 of the world's nations join in. In relation to the (human) population however, this is only 15%. 
    Orangutans are granted human rights posthumously.
