    Earth is engulfed in turmoil as rumors of a faster-than-light (FTL) space drive spark the Expansionist Uprising. These rumors stem from a press release about the "Metric Track" experiment, which announces a breakthrough in space modulation research, suggesting the potential development of an interstellar drive. However, this breakthrough is primarily financial, securing funding for the second phase of the project to control space bubbles from within. Despite claims of imminent FTL technology, genuine breakthroughs remain centuries away. The expansionist factions, frustrated with Earth's inward-focused policies since the Great Separation of 2284, see these rumors as a beacon of hope, leading to widespread protests that quickly escalate into violent clashes and civil unrest.
    The general populace, while largely supportive of Earth’s ecological restoration, still harbors deep-seated aspirations for humanity's future in space. The brutal suppression of the Expansionist movement, marked by increased surveillance and a system of denunciations, only radicalizes the movement further and garners new followers. Expressing expansionist ideas becomes treasonous, leading to severe penalties. 
    Amid this oppressive atmosphere, many expansionists choose to emigrate to interplanetary settlements, marking the third great wave of emigration to space. These emigrants, well-educated and wealthy by Earth's standards, initially face challenges adapting to the advanced interplanetary society. While some manage to acquire the necessary skills, others struggle, yet all of them contribute to the rapid growth of the interplanetary civilization. This wave of emigration constitutes a significant outflow of capital as many wealth expansionists transfer their assets to space.
    The influx of immigrants revitalizes the interplanetary settlements, bringing new resources but also straining limited supplies and living space. This wave of emigration exacerbates the ongoing crisis triggered by Earth's separation, yet it also accelerates the solution by increasing well-funded habitat building primarily in cis-lunar space, in wide earth orbits, at the earth-moon 
    Lagrange points and on the moon surface. 
    Unintended by Earth, the repression of Expansionism and the subsequent wave of emigration result in one last significant subsidy boost from Earth for the interplanetary civilization.
