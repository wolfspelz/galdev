    The United Planets Organization (UPO) undergoes a significant reorganization, transforming into the Solar Coalition. This shift was driven by Earth's increasing isolationism and its withdrawal from interplanetary affairs. As Earth turns inward, space-based nations and habitats need a new framework for cooperation and mutual support, especially in light of Earth's growing hostility.
    Despite its retreat from interplanetary relations, Earth remains a colossal force in terms of economic activity, population, and culture. The planet is an economic powerhouse, teeming with countless enterprises, hundreds of nations, and a diverse population numbering in the billions. Its cultural richness far surpasses that of the fledgling interplanetary civilization, which, despite its automation-driven economic growth, is still in its infancy. For many, Earth's departure from the UPO feels like the heart being torn from the Sol System. Without Earth, the Sol System seems a smaller and poorer place, at least for several decades until the interplanetary civilization fills the void both culturally and economically.
    In response to Earth's exit, the Solar Coalition is formed to provide a unified platform for technological collaboration and cultural exchange among its members. This new organization aims to foster a sense of unity and shared purpose among its diverse participants, which includes the Martian Republics, the Ganymede Directorate, the Palladian League, and numerous independent space stations and habitats.
    Over the next two centuries, the Solar Coalition emerges as the primary organizing body for interplanetary relations. Though it never becomes a unified government, it successfully maintains stability laying the groundwork for the interplanetary economy to flourish independently of Earth.
    Vegas/Luna is selected as the seat of the newly formed Solar Coalition. This choice underscores the independence of Earth's Moon from terrestrial developments signaling that the Moon is an integral part of the interplanetary civilization.
