  In the year 2187, a striking shift occurs in the already complex landscape of lunar and interplanetary habitation. A drastic solution to escalating labor issues in space industries is conceived. Governments and corporations around the world decide to deport long-term prisoners to the Moon, an initiative born out of desperation and controversial from the outset. 
  The backdrop to this decision is a lethal cocktail of factors. Increasing asteroid mining accidents, soaring death tolls among miners, and a dwindling workforce begin to gnaw at the financial viability of space industries. From 2167 onward, recruiting sufficient well-trained engineers for hazardous asteroid mining jobs proves increasingly difficult.  
  A pivotal moment arrives in 2172 when pilot programs offer prisoners reduced sentences in return for their services in asteroid mining. Despite fierce criticism from human rights groups, these programs are initially economically successful. This success propels the initiative forward, and by 2182, long-term prisoners are offered the option to serve their sentences on the Moon working in ice mines and living in normal quarters instead of staying prison cells. The first lunar deportations in 2187 mark a turning point. The forced addition of prisoners to the lunar population sparks a plethora of new challenges, social tensions, and socioeconomic shifts. The utilization of prisoners as a low-cost workforce in the perilous domain of asteroid mining shows the profound influence of commercial interests on public policy. 
  From 2187 to 2215, a series of fatal accidents in lunar and asteroid mining underscore a blatant indifference towards the safety of space workers. Governments and corporations often neglecting worker safety in the pursuit of profit, with prisoner labor programs exacerbating the risk: 
  A Scandinavian initiative to employ prisoners in asteroid mining ends in disaster due to a flagrant violation of safety protocols. The explosion results in three fatalities. In another Brazil's new lunar ice mining base "Yara" suffers a structural collapse killing 5 workers and injuring 15. Australian spacecraft "Eureka" crash lands on the lunar surface during a prisoner transfer. 8 prisoners and 3 crew members die in the accident. A shockwave in a rubble pile asteroid sets gigatons of rocks in motion causing severe damage to the "Yue Liang" with 13 casualties. A Kenyan penal base on the Moon is engulfed in a massive fire that kills 15 prisoners and two staff members. The Mexican "Luna Libre" Rehabilitation Base suffers a decompression accident killing 10 prisoners and injuring 13 others. 2209: The fatal lunar base blowout with 45 casualties: an equipment malfunction turns catastrophic when neglected maintenance prevents emergency doors from closing. The Nigerian prospecting and mining vessel "Akwụkwọ Nsọ" suffers a major failure during an asteroid mining operation. The living quarters module accidently detaches and collides with an asteroid resulting in 12 victims. The list goes on. 
  Following the tragic lunar base incident in 2209 with so many casualties, human rights campaigns intensify their efforts. The catastrophe sparks new debates about labor rights and ethical business practices. Human rights organizations argue that the harsh conditions in space and the high mortality rates were akin to a death sentence for these prisoners. The fight against prisoner deportations and a push for improved safety conditions for all space workers gain significant traction. By 2215, these campaigns successfully lobby for an outright ban on prisoner deportations to the Moon.
  This ban leaves space companies grappling with a severe labor shortage. As a result, they pivot their strategy towards investing more in their workforce, improving safety protocols and providing better equipment. The Peace Corps Space Patrol plays a key role by releasing new safety standards, which are subsequently enforced by insurance companies, making adherence to safety regulations an industry-wide imperative.
  A slowdown in prospecting and extraction activities due to workforce shortage causes a temporary crisis in the availability of cheap construction materials in orbit. However, this hurdle is overcome as the industry's investment in safety protocols and increased salaries start to attract a larger number of voluntary workers.
  Ironically, what begins as a human rights issue ends up being the catalyst for a major shift in the space industry. As space companies succeed in making space work safer and more attractive, the availability of raw materials in orbit increases exponentially. The resultant drop in prices sparks an economic boom in the space industry.
