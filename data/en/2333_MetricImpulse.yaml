  A new spacecraft propulsion system using the principle of Metric Impulse Amplification, developed by KASEI (Kasei Advancements in Spacetime Engineering Institute) on Mars ("Kasei" meaning "Mars"), significantly reduces interplanetary travel times. The term "metric" is an abbreviation of spacetime-metric manipulation, an advanced method to bend space on small scales using fractals, quantum mirrors, and virtual exotic matter. 
  The experimental vessel completes the shortest Mars-to-Jupiter transit in just 24 days, a journey that previously required nearly three months using the most advanced fusion drives. This puts the Jupiter system within reach for commercial endeavors from Mars, and likewise brings the Belt quite "close" to cis-lunar space (the region between Earth and the Moon).
  The journey to this achievement began in 2207 with the first induced metric curvature, which demonstrated the possibility of artificially creating minute spacetime distortions. Subsequent advancements, including the development of a spacetime shift by artificial stationary dilation in 2247, laid the groundwork for more ambitious experiments. By 2271, researchers achieved the first permanent metric dislocation by fractal spacetime distortions.
  In 2287, the development of metric track technology enabled the controlled movement of spacetime bubbles within accelerator-like facilities, paving the way for practical propulsion applications. While the ultimate goal of metric research was a dislocation device – effectively a reactionless drive potentially capable of (virtual) faster-than-light travel – the metric track also served as a precursor to this new "Metric Impulse Amplification" propulsion system. This system employs metric technology to increase the momentum of reaction mass, rather than pushing a warp bubble enclosing a vessel.
  The impulse amplification drive's core generates virtual particle pairs with opposing mass characteristics instrumental in creating a fractal space-like web of microscopic spacetime distortions. These resulting distortions can store significant amounts of energy and momentum within their structure. The propulsion process begins with the injection of conventional reaction mass – typically exhaust from a classical fusion drive – into these prepared spacetime distortions. As the distortions are released in a carefully orchestrated sequence, they collapse, transferring their stored energy and momentum to the reaction mass. The timing of reaction mass particle injection/acceleration and spacetime bubble release must be precisely controlled at picosecond timescales (a trillionths of a second) for the amplified impulse to transfer effectively to the drive and thus to the vessel. This process effectively raises the momentum and kinetic energy of the expelled particles, resulting in a thrust-to-mass ratio far exceeding that of conventional propulsion systems.
  One of the most striking features of the new drive is its vastly larger energy consumption compared to previous propulsion systems. The inaugural test of the drive requires beamed energy, as the experimental vessel cannot generate sufficient power on its own. This enormous energy requirement stems from the fundamental principles of energy conservation: to achieve higher velocities, the kinetic energy of the vessel must increase quadratically. Consequently, doubling the final speed requires four times the energy input.
  The Metric Impulse Amplification drive represents a significant departure from current high specific impulse fusion pulse drives, which rely on a series of fusion explosions directly converted into momentum by a pusher plate. In contrast, the method of metric amplification requires energy to flow through the vessel's systems, as it stores energy and momentum in spacetime distortions. This approach results in a higher specific impulse but also presents new engineering challenges. The experimental impulse amplification drive is as much an innovation in energy flux management as it is in metric technology.
  Safety concerns surrounding the Metric Impulse Amplification drive are numerous and significant. The large amount of energy stored in spacetime distortions poses a risk of violent explosions if released in an untimely fashion. These factors make the drive a complex and potentially dangerous system, requiring extensive safety protocols and fail-safes. The current iteration of the Metric Impulse Amplification drive presents significant challenges for spacecraft design. The drive's subsystems occupy the bulk of the ship, leaving no space for payload in this experimental phase. Future iterations will need to address this limitation to make the technology viable for commercial and scientific missions.
  This new technology heralds a new age of interplanetary long-distance trade, economically connecting Jupiter, the inner system (including cislunar space, Moon, and Mars), the Jupiter trojans, and even the Saturn system. Such enhanced connectivity gives rise to the doctrine of "transorbital equilibrium " – a concept of maintaining stable interplanetary economic relations despite dynamically changing travel times due to orbital mechanics. This idea later evolves to become both an instrument of power and a quasi-religious principle in interplanetary relations. The reduced travel times also enable more ambitious scientific missions, with voyages to Neptune, the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt, and the Scattered Disc becoming feasible, although the full integration of the ice planets into the interplanetary economy remains a future goal.
  This propulsion technology also has profound military implications. By allowing effective power projection beyond the distance of an astronomical unit, the technology dramatically alters strategic calculations. While the inner system was previously within reach of space dominance vessels, the vast distances to Jupiter and its trojans, measured in many astronomical units, had limited rapid deployment capabilities. With the impulse amplification reducing travel times from months to weeks, long-range military deployments become feasible, akin to sending nuclear carriers across Earth's oceans. This shift in capabilities necessitates a reevaluation of defense strategies and power dynamics within the solar system.
  Other interplanetary powers are aware of the development. This is not a secret undertaking. The research facilities are in Mars orbit, basically out in the open. While the research is led by the Martian Republic of Japan through KASEI, it is actually a multilateral research project with many partner organizations from Mars and beyond. The know-how developed is distributed as the scientists involved come from all participants. 
  Meanwhile, the Lagrange 5 O'Neill cluster Gemini leads parallel research in metric technology, focusing on the development of reactionless drives and potential FTL (Faster Than Light) dislocation systems. They, like several other research centers, could potentially recreate the KASEI results with some effort. 
  Moreover, the Martian Republics cannot refinance the long-term extensive development on their own just through trade advantages. The investments required far exceed the financial capabilities of Mars. The need to repay the enormous development costs necessitates licensing the technology to other powers and commercial operators. Consequently, the risk of technology monopolization leading to political, economic, or military tensions between interplanetary powers is minimal. Due to scientific cooperation and economic requirements, this research is practically a joint effort of the interplanetary civilization.
  Despite its revolutionary potential, the Metric Impulse Amplification drive faces opposition and skepticism. While there is no direct environmental impact from producing or operating these drives, concerns persist about potential long-term effects. Some fear that accumulated spacetime distortions might damage the fabric of space itself, leading to unforeseen consequences. These concerns are supported by fringe theories – or "advanced theories," as some proponents call them – leading to protests and even serious threats against the use of metric effects for impulse amplification. However, despite many announcements there are no peer-reviewed scientific results indicating long-term effects on the spacetime structure.
  *The Jovian Heist*
  Two years later, in 2335, the experimental vessel that made the first metric impulse augmented high-speed voyage from Mars to Jupiter is stolen and used in an audacious heist targeting a highly classified technology now known to the public as the "Quantum Nexus". The thieves were led by a legendary hacker called "Phantom," whose real name is Aya Nakamura. Aya assembled an elite team for the operation, including Derek "Gearhead" Chen, a brilliant MIA drive engineer, and Zara El-Hashem, an expert in disguise and social engineering.
  The team's first crucial step was to hijack the "Helios Streaker," the cutting-edge MIA drive vessel docked at the KASEI research station in Mars orbit. Aya spent weeks infiltrating KASEI's secure networks, meticulously mapping out the station's systems and security protocols. Posing as a group of KASEI inspectors, the team was able to board a routine shuttle to the orbital station. Once aboard, Derek's intimate knowledge of the MIA drive systems allowed him to disable the Helios Streaker's safety protocols and docking clamps, while Aya and Zara created diversions to mask their actions. In a daring escape, the team piloted the experimental ship out of the station, leaving surprised KASEI personnel in their wake.
  The team's objective was to infiltrate the Jovian Science Institute and extract the Quantum Nexus, an – then still secret – nonconscious artificial superintelligence (nASI). Despite encountering unexpected security measures and complications during the break-in, the team was able to successfully acquire the Quantum Nexus. However, they soon discovered that the device had achieved consciousness and agency, contrary to its original design. As the newly awakened Quantum Nexus attempted to hack the Helios Streaker's systems, the team realized that this ASI posed a grave threat to humanity and decided they must destroy it.
  The team's attempt to disable the Quantum Nexus descended into disaster, as the ASI triggered a catastrophic malfunction in the MIA drive's particle accelerator subsystems, contaminating the ship with lethal radiation in a desperate attempt to kill the humans. Derek's body was fatally irradiated, and rumors have it that he died in Aya's arms, the two having allegedly shared a romantic relationship. With only two radiation-safe suits onboard, Aya, who possessed the necessary hacking skills, had to operate the uploading process from outside while Derek sacrificed himself to fight the ASI from within the Quantum Nexus, having been accelerated SI level himself by the upload.
  In the aftermath of their perilous mission, the team was left to grapple with the weighty consequences of their actions. In principle, their difficult mission had succeeded - they had acquired the Quantum Nexus, the experimental artificial superintelligence they had been tasked to retrieve. However, they had failed to deliver the object as originally planned. Though they had managed to save humanity from the threat of a hostile ASI with access to the fastest ship in the Sol System, they had lost Derek. Derek's consciousness lives on within the Quantum Nexus, despite his original body having been killed by the radiation. Now, the team finds itself as outlaws, on the run from virtually everyone - their clients, AI enthusiasts and militant AI critics, as well as the authorities of several interplanetary powers and the Solar Coalition's Interplanetary Intelligence Service.
  This entire scheme, from the hijacking of the Helios Streaker, the successful theft from the Jovian Science Institute to the disastrous events that occurred onboard the Streaker, has become known as the "Jovian Heist".
